<p>"The world has gone mad".  I've never thought deeply about the phrase before. The question whether the world has gone mad never came up to me. For me the world has never not been crazy. The craziness seemed to change only in waves: sometimes more, sometimes less.
</p>
<p> Now I have children. It made me look for an answer. And the answer is that the world is actually getting crazier. </p>

<p> Let me share what I found out. To find an answer, all events in the world would have to be compared. If today's events are crazy and those of the past are less crazy, the phrase would have some truth to it. The good news is that a comprehensive investigation is not necessary. There is a little trick you can use in judging events to expose them as crazy. If the event is particularly unprecedented, we perceive it as crazy.
</p>
<p>
As everyone knows unprecedented events pop up everywhere. The two forces globalization and innovation fuel the creation of these events. Globalization causes an events reproduction and reach (n + 1) and the level of novelty causes the steepness of the curve (0 => 1). At its highest possible intersection the pull of humans toward the event is highest. Thus events tend to be unprecedented by nature and some event reach peeks.
</p>
<p>
It is not so long ago that the world is so densely connected. By now the world has learned to cope with globalization. But it has not tried a serious approach to address global issues with global institutions that make sense. The world can be compared to a teenager in an identity crisis. Physical possibility and still irrational judgement reaches its highest point of intersection. The results are unprecedented events hitting a teenager’s mind.
</p>
<p>
This becomes obvious with events that have impact on the context we live in. This varies by degree. Few people can remember the day when the first direct observation of gravitational waves was announced (February 11, 2016).  For physicists this was a crazy event.  But everybody knows what happened on September 11, 2001, even physicists. I am not saying that both events can be compared based on their content but how they impact society.
</p>
<p>
The level of impact is relative, since it changes during time. The amount of energy an event holds is interchangeable with its mass. Similar like atoms, even tiny events can hold massive amounts of energy.
</p>
<p>
In the course of time some events seem to be insignificant for a short time. Years later they turn out to be world-changing events. At first the birth of Christ was only important to a few people, let alone seen as a historical event. Today the calendar of the whole world revolves around His birth year.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so events in the world show that they tend to be unprecedented and thus are perceived as crazy. Does it make a difference knowing that?
</p>
<p>
It makes a big difference to me. It means that the phrase "the world has gone mad" is not only a figure of speech to express one's displeasure. It's not just a phrase to express disbelief.  It makes me think about how to avoid and help change crazy developments.
And the world for my children should not only not be crazy. It should be like Jürgen Klopp "the normal one." (2) Specifically, I ask myself what I can do to make my children happy and keep them happy.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
To create happiness for my children, I need to know what makes up happiness (3). This is not as simple as it seems. Most people know when they are happy, but very few, including me, can define happiness (4).  Less difficult is to look at the prerequisites for happiness on a macro level.
</p>
<p>
As Maria Montessori said, we receive everything we need from people. Thus our happiness does indeed depend on other people and us. Everything we call the framework for "life" has been built by people who are just like us. This means that we are able to influence our environment in a substantial way.
</p>
<p>
Many of the things humans cause are positive things, such as the invention of the internet. And since mass attracts mass these events increase at an accelerated rate.
Imagine a graph that represented every important event of the last 1,000 years known to us as a dot. The picture would look like a hockey stick. The stick is gradually getting thicker with a steep curve at the end. (1)
</p>
<p>
Normal distribution shows that there also exist unprecedented events that endanger our civilization. Thus they undermine the framework conditions for happiness. The attentive reader may say this is an exaggeration. Isn’t our civilization - at least in the political West - stable? Why should unprecedented events attack them?
</p>
<p>
Important for a stable civilization is our trust in it. The world can handle disasters, but only as long as most people have a strong belief in civilization. Trust in being able to handle threats. We need to trust in our civilization’s philosophy, laws. There must be confidence to achieve social and material prosperity through honest behavior.
</p>
<p>
The example of Rome has shown that even complex and seemingly stable civilizations are rather fragile. They can be destroyed.
</p>
<p>
What should you look out for in order not to jeopardize your happiness? One of the greatest enemies of a civilization is fear. Fear of things that make life no longer worth living, like disease, war or poverty.  The second great enemy is hopelessness and lack of meaning. When you lose hope to have a happy life, you will question your identity and the role of your environment. This opens the doors for demagogues. Almost everyone who touches the masses with targeted emotional impulses has an easy job moving those masses. The alternative is gratefully accepted, everything is better than nothing.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Now you "only" have to be vigilant regarding the those events that foster the social and material well being of your environment.  You can’t be vigilant in any aspect of life. But you can be in your own fields of expertise. No matter the discipline you are engaged in, may it be economics, education, history, social science, philosophy, and sports or whatever it may be.  You can reflect on the events happening in your field of expertise.
</p>
<p>
There is something counterintuitive here. Before you reflect you have to try to disenthrall yourself from how things used to be done.  Being a part of the world makes the necessary objective view on things quite difficult. It would require the understanding of the reality of things in total and how all things relate to each other.
